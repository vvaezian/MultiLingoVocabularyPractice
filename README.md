# MultiLingoVocabularyPractice

This is an android app designed for people who are learning different languages. 

Let's say a user is learning French and German. When s/he logs in, app randomely chooses a words from its database (let's say "cat") and shows two flags, one for French and one for German along with the word "cat". The user should try to recall the translation of "cat" in Germen and French. By tapping on flags, the translation of "cat" in that language is revealed. 

The user can add or delete words to/from the database.

#### To-Do
- Add button for Pronunciation
- Password Reset
- Add flag for source language
- Google/FB Sign-in
- Fill out the empty values in the database (if user adds a language, the previously added words should be translated in the new language)
- Move files to another server

#### Bugs to Fix
- Lower/upper case words are treated as two words
- Specifying the source language when translating sometimes crashes
