# MultiLingoVocabularyPractice

This is an android app designed for people who are learning different languages. 

Let's say a user is learning French and German. When s/he logs in, app randomely chooses a words from its database (let's say "cat") and shows two flags, on for French and one for German along with the word "cat". The user should try to recall the translation of "cat" in Germen and French. By tapping on flags, the translation of "cat" in that language is revealed. 

The user can add or delete words from the database.
